This is a trivial app for me to get some hands-on experience with:
- React/Rust
- VPS deployment

The app code was graciously provided free of charge by Claude 3.7.
Hosting by DigitalOcean.

TODO:
- Set up CD to push to the droplet on source push.
- Nginx on the droplet to make it serious.
- A proper domain name and SSL.
